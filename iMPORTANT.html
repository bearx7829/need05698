Sale of Personal Information of Minors Under 16 Years of Age
We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under the age of 16 through our Service, although certain third party websites that we link to may do so. These third-party websites have their own terms of use and privacy policies and we encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and instruct their children to never provide information on other websites without their permission.

We do not sell the personal information of Consumers We actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless We receive affirmative authorization (the "right to opt-in") from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to the sale of personal information may opt-out of future sales at any time. To exercise the right to opt-out, You (or Your authorized representative) may submit a request to Us by contacting Us.

If You have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 (or 16) has provided Us with personal information, please contact Us with sufficient detail to enable Us to delete that information.

For the EPD selection, the focus was mainly set on European EPD databases in compliance with the EN 15804:2012+A1:2013—with the product stage as the minimum scope—which are depicted in Table 1. These databases are available through EPD programs run by program operators, which operate voluntary programs for the development and implementation based on a set of specific rules [30]. The program operator can be either a company, industrial sector or associations, public authorities or a scientific body [30]. Some examples of program operators are the German Institut Bauen und Umwelt e.V. with the program IBU-EPD, Building Research Establishment Limited (BRE), which runs GreenBook Live in the United Kingdom, and Centre Scientifique et Technique du Bâtiment (CSTB), that operates INIES in France..</p>
