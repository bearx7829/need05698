A boarding school reunion set around Christmas time in the British countryside, followed by plenty of merrymaking and midnight snow croquet in a castle, Jenny Bayliss’ latest novel is sure to get you festive. will take in the spirit of And if you’re looking for a totally uplifting, easy read for that luxurious time between Christmas and New Year, otherwise known as Betwixmas, this one ticks all the boxes!</p><p>Beautiful festival Meet me under the mistletoe There’s a heartwarming story about curling up in front of a roaring fire and embracing the holiday season for what it really is: lazing around the house in Christmas PJs for 5-7 workdays.</p><p>So, avoid the chaos of Christmas tree shopping (related), gift wrapping and rearranging, and snuggle up on the sofa with this imaginative crackers and Boxing Day leftovers smorgasbord.</p><p>Read on to find out how the Zoella team ranked December’s reading…</p><p>The blurb</p><p>A winter wedding of old friends should be the event of the year. Gathering near her former school for a spectacular, week-long celebration, Nori Noel is reunited with her best friends. But now in his thirties, that group has long since broken up.</p><p>Noori suspects she’ll spend Saturday wrestling in spanks, dodging questions about her non-existent plus one. Only his fearless, brilliant best friend Amira can convince him to go.</p><p>Set in a majestic Kent castle, it’s not long before personalities clash and old tensions begin to bubble up. Nori finds herself slipping away – and unexpectedly bumps into Isaac, the palace gardener and her old school rival.</p><p>Noori and Ishaq have more in common these days than they ever imagined. But when she takes more time away from the festivities to spend with Isaac, she uncovers a shocking secret about her family’s past. Nori knows she alone can help right this wrong – but uncovering the truth could mean pushing Isaac away once again.</p><p><br></p><p>REVIEW OF LAURIS</p><p>Bah humbug alert, I don’t usually gravitate towards Christmas fluff reads but kudos to Jenny Bayliss because this one totally exceeded expectations. It’s more than just an expected festival story, which I’m here for if there’s a good story to go with it. Meet me under the mistletoe A modern-day Lady is like Chatterley’s Lover, with all the ingredients of a 5-star contemporary read: friend-lovers, interesting friendship dynamics, interesting couple dynamics, high school reunion vibes, very much! I also loved that Eleanor (Norrie) owns a bookstore – books about books &gt; books about everything. In fact, if I had a second-hand bookshop like Serendipitous Seconds, I’d have a hard time parting with my favorite treasured first editions, like Norrie. MMUTM is a great cozy winter read for this time of year that balances humor with heavy themes such as grief, adultery, classism, racism, and although not as festive as some readers might find the title to be. As one might expect, the ice castle setting and chef’s kiss cast of characters is more than that. You will see!</p><p>Classification: 4/5</p><p>Would you recommend it? 100% It’s the easy December weather everyone deserves.</p><p>LILY’S REVIEW</p><p>First things first, I did not expect this story! I was expecting a light, cheerful love story. However, it is much more than that. Jenny Bayliss writes a beautiful festive story. Expressing that even during Christmas, life is not a short line. It can go up and down, shift, and shorten in different ways.</p><p>Meet Me Under the Mistletoe takes place around the festive season, but mainly talks about the dynamic of a friendship group, and how life goes on even after the loss of someone close. I love these kinds of stories, especially at Christmas time. Because it’s a gentle reminder that it’s not always an easy, fun, happy time for everyone. But don’t get me wrong, there’s still a warmth to this book that gives it a festive cozy coating for a charming breezy read!</p><p>A humble, interesting, sad, festive story. Where every chapter was a gift that kept on giving!! I highly recommend it to those who loved the Christmas movie ‘Last Christmas’ or ‘PS’. I love you’.</p><p>Classification: 4/5</p><p>Would you recommend it? Yes! Such a lovely book, perfect December read.</p><p>DANIEL’S REVIEW</p><p>This book is not Jenny’s first foray into Christmas literature and by God, I hope it’s not her last! The book features some of the coziest Christmas settings, such as castles and London, but my favorite has to be Norrie’s Secondhand Bookshop. I loved the concept of matchmaking books for customers and I especially enjoyed this aspect as our final Zoella Book Club selection of the year! It’s a real pleasure to choose books that we think our audience will enjoy and I hope you have fulfilled and inspired ZBC reading in 2022.</p><p>This book just captures Christmas perfectly, personally, I’m very close to my family but I know a lot of people who aren’t and the way Nori surrounded herself with family was beautiful. . If you love Nancy Meyers or Nora Ephron movies like You’ve Got Mail, you’ll love this book, completely classic and wonderfully illustrated. I would recommend to anyone looking for a festive read.</p><p>Classification: 5/5</p><p>Would you recommend it? I already gave it to my mom!</p><p><br></p></div><!--/blog_post_content-->
