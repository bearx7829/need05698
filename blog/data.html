This refers to the use of tools and processes to convert an organization into a data -driven enterprise.</p><p>The term "Data Fiction" was introduced by Kenneth Cocherry and Victor Mayor Sachinberg in 2013 to refer to the hidden process converting to data that companies can use to improve their business.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>And there may be many examples of the detection.</p><p>Let us say that social platform, Facebook or Instagram, for example, monitor our friendship data information about market products and services and services and monitoring services for agencies. As a result, our behavior is changed. The promotions that we see on the daily society are also the result of surveillance data. In this model, the data is used to explain how the material is manufactured by data fiction that is used to inform the material rather than the recommended system.</p><p>However, there are also other industries where the data fictitious process is actively used:</p><p>Insurance: Risk profile development and data used to update business models.</p><p>Banking: Data used to establish confidence and possibilities to repay a person's loan.</p><p>Human Resources: Such as data used to identify. Employees Risk Profiles.</p><p>Job and recruitment: Data used to change personality tests.</p><p>Social Science Research: Data fiction replaces sample techniques and reorns the manner in which social science research is performed.</p><p>Why is a data fiction necessary?</p><p>Organizations can only maintain sophisticated technological developments if they turn to data fiction. Industry companies can do data to improve their many critical processes. Once this process is measuring, it is immediately able to improve.</p><p>Data fictitations make the business improving the process and pads their income. At the micro level, it can help organizations meet daily tasks during maximum resources. At the macro level, it can smooth the current process, which can keep users competitive.</p><p>How to Datify Your Business:</p><p>There are some ways to successfully get your business:</p><p>Use the correct technology:</p><p>You can start gaining data into your business by integrating your business into the Internet of Thang (IOT). This means keeping the right technology, such as mobile devices, wearing, Bluetooth bacon, and voice assistants, place.</p><p>Use the appropriate platform:</p><p>Once you have infrastructure, choose the right platform that will allow you to effectively extract data. This platform should develop data you needed to research. It should also be able to convert the large quantity of online data into structural and machine -read information. The right platform will provide you with the right tools to monitor and analyze trends to enhance your decision -making process.</p><p>Make a central repository:</p><p>Working with all available data is the only way to do data fiction work. In this way, you need the same storage in which everyone can access the organization.</p><p><br></p><p>What are the existing data fiction applications?</p><p>Data Factation is no longer just a buzzing word because there are numerous applications in multiple industries that include:</p><p>Human resources management:</p><p>Companies can collect data from mobile phones, social media, and apps to identify potential capabilities and analyze their characteristics, including their personalities and risk profiles. Instead of taking the personality tests to the applicant, the data fiction can measure analytical thinking whether the candidates are matching the company's culture and their role for which they are applying.</p><p>Data fictitious can develop new personality measures that recruiters can use.</p><p>customer relationship management:</p><p>Enterprises that use customer data also benefit from the use of data fiction tools and strategies to understand their clients. They can create appropriate stimulations for their target audience purchase behavior and personalities.</p><p>Data fiction allows companies to collect data based on phone calls, emails, and potential users of tones and language users in social media.</p><p>Trade real estate:</p><p>In the real estate industry, especially in the commercial real estate, data fiction can be useful. Real estate companies can use data fiction tools and strategies to gain deep insights at various locations. In this way, they will know that if they are seeing a piece of property, it is ideal for a client who wants to do a lucrative business.</p><p>Supply of financial services:</p><p>Perhaps in all industries, the financial services sector can benefit most from data fiction. Insurance agencies find data fiction to understand a person's risk profile and update their business models. The banking industry can also use it to predict a person's debt or mortgage payment ability.</p><p>From digitalization to data fiction:</p><p>Currently, the interaction between the information technology and the public sector has been discussed primarily under the label of the e -government. The concept of e -government accepts a widespread interaction between the government and the society, but in practice, it is primarily focused on providing good services.</p><p>Of course, for most countries, the most important pattern of E -Government is the "Digital Front Office". But this scenario is changing substantially for the E -government, which has to introduce a new wave of technologies, including Internet -offs, big data analtics, robots, blockchain, etc. The new sample is firmly rooted in the internet -based service delivery model because one of the current digital front office is becoming increasingly obsolete. Although it has been useful for digitalizing government services for many years, it may not be worth the changes that will march towards new technology to society.</p><p>The basic driving force is behind this effect. This trend is the effect of combined and interdisciplinary use of computer, telecom and chip technology in our societies and most aspects of our daily life. Governments are already digging at the local level, and smart cities are gaining popularity. This smart revolution of cities shows a huge promise to solve the most difficult of problems.</p></div><!--/blog_post_content-->
