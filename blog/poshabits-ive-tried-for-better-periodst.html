This Judy Bloom looks like the beginning of the novel, but my era has never been my friend. More than half of my life has spent monthly intense mood swings, severe bloating, and narrowing, so that I will have to go home from school. As a pretin and a newly appointed "woman", I tried to double on Advil, tried to spend hours under the heating pad, and eventually my Gyno suggested the pain reducing (I know Yes, okay? Yes!).</p><p>Enter: 25 -year -old Josi. I am a bit more confident, self -esteem and adult (kind of self -esteem) than a 12 -year -old girl who cried about going to a ballet class during her term. I don't have to go home from school (I mean, work) during a month now, but I'm still so upset that I don't just be just every minute, I wish I am (and no Advil's No quantity) Or Dark Chocolate Square will change it). After the endless cycle of pain, PMS, and heavy bleeding, I am feeling as if my body is more my enemy than my friend.</p><p>But since I was 12 years old, I took courses and wrote thesis on the ancient forms of Madison, I studied at Nutrition School, and I became a certified health coach. I have made food and lifestyle changes that make me feel happy, dynamic and excited as I have never had before. I know more about my body and believe that a symbol (yes, even PMS or heavy bleeding) is the way the body is the way that something is coming to an end "The way my body is." In my 13 years as a menstrual period (Major * Crane *), I have tried enough to help reduce my term symptoms. Here are eight most notable habits and whether they have helped in reality.</p><p>Eating more foods :</p><p>Traditionally, my era was my personal excuse that it was to eat all the pasta and gallons of ice cream. I always face intense desires that I used to give him, but even more importantly, I felt so restless this week that food became a form of comfort. However, as I learned about the role that the body feels about, I have my "food, bleeding," mentality (have graphic visual overall? ) Started questioning. Instead, I cut the gluten (about which I knew I was sensitized thanks to the tests done by my doctor), packed with fruits and vegetables, and was preferred to eat iron -rich food. Such as beans and dark, leafy vegetables.</p><p><br></p><p>Even I started to treat myself in plant -based food supply during my period week so I am eating extra clean (and so I don't get off the sofa to cook or wash dirty dishes If I didn't want to.) When I started to crack a heavy or sweet thing in my period, I listened to it instead of pressing it, knowing that my body knew what he needed. - But instead of pasta or MacN 'cheese, I made a hot rice dish, and instead of tieting a whole tub of Ben &amp; Jerry, there were some dark chocolate squares to satisfy me.</p><p>Cycle Syncing</p><p>Cycle synchronization is exactly what it seems: to harmonize your lifestyle, exercise and diet around your cycle. Some people call it an ancient fitness technique, and some call it bio -hack. Cycle synchronization is the idea that your hormones are different at each stage, and for this reason, your needs, emotions and energy levels are also. Think about it: There are four stages of the moon, there are four stages of the seasons, and we as women are four stages.</p><p>I tried to harmonize the 2020way: by downloading an app. My flu helps you track your cycle so you can know what to expect, but it also gives you the tips on where you are in your cycle from eating everything What kind of exercise should you do until eating? Usually, according to Mayo flu and cycle synchronization, hormones (and 28 -day cycle on which they are running) tell us everything we should go out or stay inside, raw food or cooked food ( And how), or what we are in a sex mood.</p><p>Gentle exercise</p><p>Hit nonsense back to this day: I felt the intense workouts I usually wish that I feel bad if I try to advance it on my term. I feel incompetent, vibrant and tired. Certainly, I'm always happy that I did this after that, but I swear that it worsens the pain throughout the day, and I didn't like to do it, because I knew that exercise Had to feel. So instead? I stopped doing anything to do myself and instead chose a slow, soft move, such as stretching, yoga flow, or a little palette if I think I should really go crazy.</p><p>Natural supplements</p><p>Many gynecologists and doctors have put me on the dual doses of adveler, helping the aforementioned prescription pain, or birth -controlling pills (more on it) to help with duration of pain. , But instead of pushing more emphasis on ibuprofen or eliminating pain, I have learned that I have learned. Which helps me more than patching symptoms as a way to fix my body as a way to fix the cause of root. I have tried a combination of Chinese herbs, vitamins and minerals, and all natural compounds that are said to help menstruation.</p><p>The most notable supplements I have tried in the past few years are Rasbury Leaf tea (which is recommended by Barian Berry), to help strengthen the uterus. I love welfare '#Mod tablets to help with PMS. And the magnesium citrate, which my doctor recommended every night with an extra dose every night.</p><p>Oral birth control&nbsp;</p><p>First of all, a revelation: between noviring, shots, IUDs, patches and pills, a way to control birth is as confused as to what breakfast is to get on the buffet of breakfast (if in Scumblared Eggs and Hash If I fill the brown, I'm sorry for not getting pancakes!). Whether you choose to control the hormonal birth, the symptoms of the duration can be reduced or to overcome the original birth (or both, which often happens), the method that is best for you is extremely personal. Your best friend, or even what is right for your doctor, may not be right for you.</p><p><br></p><p>Whether you prefer hormonal congenital control or hormone -free method, research all your options, identify the main cause of a symptom, and talk to your doctor what is better for you. For me, I have been overcome for almost 10 years oral birth. As a young man, my gynecologists controlled me birth to help reduce pain over periods because nothing else was working.</p></div><!--/blog_post_content-->
